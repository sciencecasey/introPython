Intro to Python

I wrote 4 methods for the program so that my code would be easy to debug.  I started out by organizing my plans on paper which was really helpful given the number of tasks we needed to accomplish.  I was then able to test each portion of the overall goal one at a time.  First, I read in the file containing the message in main.  Because I needed the message all at once, I read it in all at once and simply stripped whitespace.  Then I opened the frequency count and read it in line by line, splitting the input by the colon into two variables.  I chaged teh cound to an integer and then stored the pair in a tuple, all of which were compiled into a list.  I chose a tuple and list so that I could easily access both sides of the input (that with the letter and the number) but could also be secure that nothing in my code would modify the data within them.  The next mehod was get_freq_count() required method which took the input message as input and counted the number of times each letter occured in a dictionary.  I use and if control structure to increment the count if the key already existed in the dictionary.  At first, I thought this would be very resource heavy until I remembered that hash is used for dictionaries, so each check was only O(1).  I then sent the original count input and the frequency counts to a decorder method to create the decoding scheme.  It did this by looking through the list of tuples to find the same number as associated with each letter in the frequency counts.  When the numbers are encountered in the tuples, I replace the key in the frequency dictionary with the letter from the tuple.  Last, I use this modified dictionary to decrypt the message by creating a new string with each input letter looking up the key and the output message appending the value associated. Finally, I printed to output and to console. 

There are no known bugs in the progrqam.  

The fully decoded message is: ltcol thorn are the oss agents meeting in the rear of saint marys south church after rear admiral smith returns from his travel abroad to maurtania for operation illicitscent
