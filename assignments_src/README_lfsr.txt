Intro to Python module 8 & 9 - lfsr

I wrote two separate scripts, lfsr and image_encrypt to do the different portions of the assingment.  The first uses a main() method as well as an lafsr class to create and grab new pseudorandom numbers.  The second script reads in the football image, encrypts it, and decrypts it. There is also a method to calculate the value of a binary string which was simpler than converting between base systems.   

There are no known bugs in the progrqam.
